# FrontScript Tooltip Helper

This browser extension enhances the eFront embedded FrontReport coding window by providing tooltips, autocomplete, a searchable reference panel, and snippet insertion for FrontScript keywords, functions, procedures, and macros. Works on any Chrome and Edge browsers.

## Features

### Hover Tooltips
- Hover over any FrontScript keyword inside the embedded FrontReport window (CodeMirror editor) in any eFront environment (self-hosted or Cloud).
- Instantly see a helpful description and example.
- Works with all major FrontScript syntax elements.

### Autocomplete / IntelliSense (New in v2.1)
- As you type in the CodeMirror editor, a dropdown appears with matching FrontScript keywords, procs, functions, and macros.
- Each suggestion shows a color-coded category badge (Keyword, Proc, Function, Macro).
- Navigate with Arrow keys, accept with Tab or Enter, dismiss with Escape.
- Supports `%` prefix for macro suggestions.

### Searchable Side Panel (New in v2.1)
- Open a Chrome side panel from the extension popup with the "Open Reference Panel" button.
- **Reference tab**: Browse all FrontScript keywords, procs, functions, and macros with instant search and category filtering.
- **Snippets tab**: Browse 37 ready-made code templates across 11 categories (DATA Steps, PROC PRINT, PROC MEANS, PROC SORT, PROC FORMAT, PROC GCHART/GPLOT, Macro Statements, and more).
- Expand any entry to see its description, example code, and copy/insert buttons.

### Snippet Insertion (New in v2.1)
- Click "Insert into Editor" from the side panel to insert a code snippet directly into the CodeMirror editor at the cursor position.
- Click "Copy" to copy any snippet or example to your clipboard.

### General
- Lightweight, no data collection, no performance hit.
- Enable/disable tooltips and autocomplete independently from the extension popup.
